However, there are some guidelines and methods that can help you in making an informed decision:\n","\n","- Start Simple: Begin with a simple architecture and gradually increase complexity if needed.\n","- Grid Search/Random Search: Use grid search or random search to try different architectures.\n","- Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different architectures.\n","- Heuristics and Rules of Thumb: Some heuristics and empirical rules can provide starting points, such as:\n","  -    The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.\n","  -  A common practice is to start with 1-2 hidden layers."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Important
